* INTRODUCTION *


Hi, I'm Benjamin Butler, an undergraduate student majoring in Cybersecurity at Penn State. I have a developing skill set in Linux, Java, and Command Line, and have competed in several cybersecurity competitions, including the National Cyber League and Cyber Patriot.

I find Cybersecurity architecture particularly fascinating and enjoy designing secure and resilient systems that can protect against modern cyber threats. As an IST student, I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the field of Cybersecurity, and I believe that my diverse skill set and interests will help me make a positive impact in the industry.

I have also published technical articles in a magazine, and I am interested in exploring the intersection of technology and philanthropy. In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing hobbies such as game development and audio engineering.

Please feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or career opportunities. I am always excited to meet new people and learn more about the exciting developments in the world of Cybersecurity.
